        <title>2245. Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path - 16.67 runtime | 91.67 memory</title>
        <p>I got a little tired today so I just did my one daily task... but it was a medium question if that means anything</p>

        <h3>8/1/2023</h3>
        <p>Today is the first day I fail my coding streak on Leetcode... The problem was the first hard problem that appeared in the daily list, and it proved far too difficult for me</p>
        <p>The problem waas 149: Max points on a Line. This required me to go back into my math learning and I started watching videos on linear algebra. I guess it makes a lot more sense now that there is a practical use to what I am reseraching.</p>
        <p>I am getting really ehausted, so I think I will go to sleep soon, but I will be attempting to solve it again tomorrow.</p>
